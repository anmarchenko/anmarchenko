Hi there 👋 I'm a developer, who is passionate about building products that make life better, writing performant code and diving into how complex systems work. I code in ruby and elxir most of the time, occasionally using go, typescript and rust.

- 🌍 Travel is my favourite hobby. To make it better for myself I develop a [travel planning application](https://github.com/anmarchenko/hamster-travel)
- 🎮 Video games is another hobby of mine and it also deserves a [hobby project](https://github.com/anmarchenko/igroteka)
- ✍️ I occasionally write stuff on my [personal website](https://www.amarchenko.de)
