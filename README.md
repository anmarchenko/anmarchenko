Hi there 👋 I'm a developer passionate about building products that improve lives, writing efficient code, and understanding complex systems. I mostly code in Ruby and Elixir, and occasionally use Go, JavaScript, and Rust.

- 🌍 Traveling is my favorite hobby, so I created [Hamster Travel](https://github.com/anmarchenko/hamster-travel) - the only travel planner I need - to make it even better.
- 🎮 Video games is another hobby of mine, and I developed [Igroteka](https://github.com/anmarchenko/igroteka) to keep track of my gaming backlog.
- ✍️ I also write from time to time on my [personal website](https://www.amarchenko.de).
