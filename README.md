Hi there 👋 I'm a developer passionate about building great products, writing efficient code, and understanding complex systems. I mostly code in Ruby and Elixir, and occasionally use Go, JavaScript, and Rust.

- 🌍 Traveling is my favorite hobby, so I created [Hamster Travel](https://github.com/anmarchenko/hamster-travel) - the only travel planner I need - to make it even better.
- 🎮 Video games is another hobby of mine, and I developed [Igroteka](https://github.com/anmarchenko/igroteka) to keep track of my gaming backlog.
- ✍️ I also write from time to time on my [personal website](https://www.amarchenko.de).

### Work

- 🐶 [Datadog](https://github.com/DataDog): I work as a Ruby library developer at Datadog. Currently I am leading efforts to create a CI visibility Ruby library ([datadog-ci](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-ci-rb) gem) and acting as a maintainer and contributor for Datadog tracing library [ddtrace](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-rb).
- 🛍️ [Shopify](https://github.com/Shopify): I led a team of 3 backend developers to build order management functionality for the [Shopify Bundles](https://www.amarchenko.de/shopify-bundles/) app. We released the app in public beta and it is expected to be used by thousands of merchants. I also performed a deep dive on [performance issues](https://www.amarchenko.de/orders-performance-quest-at-shopify/) and discovered a [garbage collection](https://shopify.engineering/adventures-in-garbage-collection) problem in the main Ruby on Rails monolith that powers Shopify.
- 🚗 [SHARE NOW](https://www.share-now.com/de/en/): During the COVID-19 lockdown, I helped our engineering organization to mature and invest in building a competitive advantage for the future post-pandemic. I implemented a [dynamic pricing system](https://www.amarchenko.de/dynamic-pricing-for-carsharing/) that increased fleet utilization by 20%, resulting in a 10% increase in profits over the holiday season. I also ensured the internal systems powering SHARE NOW were robust by rewriting the [Vehicle Location Tracker](https://www.amarchenko.de/vehicle-location-tracker/), improving its maintainability and resilience. For more information on the technical details, please see my [blog post](https://www.amarchenko.de/dynamic-pricing-implementation/) on dynamic pricing implementation.
- 🏗️ [kloeckner-i](https://github.com/kloeckner-i): I built a [Part Manager](https://www.amarchenko.de/kloeckner-part-manager/) e-commerce app, which allowed clients to manage their steel contracts online. By utilizing the tools for [concurrent data import](https://www.amarchenko.de/data-import-pipeline-with-elixir/) provided by the Elixir language, I achieved a 6x increase in data import speed.
